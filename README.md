I found a research paper about an A.I. model that was trained to do binary classification on images of crystallization. 
I recreated the results in Python.  My metrics are a bit better and the training is faster.  My code is written in Python using Tensorflow, ResNet101 and ImageNet weights.  The metrics are presented in a ROC/AUC graph, a confusion matrix, class-wise test results, etc.
